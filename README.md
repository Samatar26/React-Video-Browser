### JSX
JSC gets transpiled to vanilla JavaScript which is supported by the browser. You can use [this repl](http://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=true&lineWrap=false&presets=react%2Cstage-2&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=false&debug=false&experimental=false&loose=false&spec=false&code=&playground=true) to see what your ES6/JSX will ultimately look like in the browser. JSX makes our component look a lot more legible/cleaner to see what's going on.

You have to pass an instance of the component when trying to render it to the DOM. The way to do this is by wrapping the name of your class in a JSX tag.
